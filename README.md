# Microservices with Java, Spring, Docker, Kubernetes
---
### implemented Metrics & Health monitoring inside microservices network using Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana using docker compose.
---
- Open the command line tool where the docker-compose.yml is present and run the docker compose command **"docker-compose up"** to start all the microservices containers with a single command. All the running containers can be validated by running a docker command **"docker ps"**.
- Open the URL http://localhost:9090/targets/ inside a browser and validate all the details, graphs present inside prometheus like we discussed in the course.
- Open the URL http://localhost:3000/login/ inside a browser and enter the login details(**admin/password**) of Grafana like we discussed in the course. Inside Grafana provide prometheus details, build custom dashboards, alerts like we discussed in the course.
- Stop all the running containers by executing the docker compose command "docker-compose down" from the location where docker-compose.yml is present.
